Assembly Reflections:
Registers & instructions: I noticed that registers are like small storage boxes inside the CPU which hold the data on which instructions are going to be performed. Instructions are very low-level and specific (like mov, add, sub).
Difference from Python: Coding in Assembly feels very detailed as it is low level while Python is higher-level and closer to human language. In Assembly,we manage memory and operations manually, but in Python most of that is handled for us.
Python Reflections:
Why easier/faster: Python is easier because it hides the hardware details, lets us write fewer lines, and gives built-in tools for math and input/output.We donâ€™t need to think about registers or memory.
Features for abstraction: Variables store data without worrying about memory, functions group reusable logic, and loops let us repeat actions without writing the same code again. These make programs simpler and more organized.

  |Variable storage |  Register (EAX)  |     x = 5      |In Assembly, variables are stored in CPU registers like EAX; in Python, variables are stored in memory and      |                 |                  |                |                                         managed automatically.                                             |
  | Printing output |     INT 21h      |     print()    |INT 21h is a DOS interrupt for system services like printing to screen; print() is a built-in function in py.   |                 |    ADD AX, BX    |      x + y     |Assembly performs arithmetic directly with registers; Python uses expressions with variables.                |
